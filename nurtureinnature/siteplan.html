                Site Name: Nurture in Nature
            </h2>
            <p>
                I created this name for the sake of this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose this name because it embodies the purpose of this website: to help parents and individuals
                without children alike, to nurture themselves and their families through experiences with nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                This name plays off of the sociological theory of 'Nature vs. Nurture' and implies that both can find
                their balance in time spent in nature.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2>
                Site Purpose
            </h2>
            <p>
                This website provides a central directory for families of young children, and individuals, to find local
                parks and greenspace in the Ottawa, Ontario area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically it provides a filterable list of greenspace and parks, a form to join the growing
                organization's embassadors in order to collect and grow the database's information about local
                parks/greenspace, and a home landing page to welcome people to the organization's website.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Scenarios
            </h2>
            <p>
                1. A young family moves into the city and is looking for fun
                outdoor activities to do with their children. They come to this
                site to save them the time and mental load of trying to sift
                through the various amenities that differing greenspaces and
                other outdoor areas would provide for their family.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. A family of young children decides they want to start spending
                more time outdoors. After living in the city for many years, they
                feel discouraged about how little space there appears to be for them
                to take their young children, especially secure, child-centered areas.
                They come to this website to find areas that are specifically designed
                to host children's play outdoors.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. A family with older children is looking for places to hike. They
                do not necessary care for parks that have playgrounds, but they would
                like to find areas that have trails good for walking.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. A grandparent wants to take their child for a playdate at a local
                park. They are able to search on this website for a playground that
                has accessible walkways in order to accomodate their wheelchair use.

                Typography
            </h2>
            <p>
                The font chosen for this website is visible on this webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Font 1 (main): Nunito Sans, sans-serif
                <br>
                You can see this font is used as the main font of the page. Example: in paragraph elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to use only one font to keep the design sleek and simple, allowing for the content and display
                of content to be the main focus of the website.
